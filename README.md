### Testing Intellij for Project Management
***
- First attempt at using Intellij for managing my projects.

**Pros so far:**
- Automatic rendering of Markdown files
- Git version control is integrated (although perhaps easier to use from the commandline?)
- Lots of things seem to work out of the box with minimal configuration
- Shortcuts are similar to Microsoft Products, i.e. you can `Alt + <Anything> through menus` 

**Cons so far:**
- Fairly heavy weight IDE.
- How easy is it to save your configuration and load on another computer? Unsure
